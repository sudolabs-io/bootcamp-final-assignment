# Sudo Academy: Capstone Project

Congratulations! You're almost there but we have one last task for you before
your graduation day. The best news? You can keep your project after the course's
over and add it to your portfolio! Ain't that cool?

It'll give you the much needed experience of working on a real-world project with
a strict and non-negotiable deadline while providing the necessary freedom to get
your wheels of creativity spinning.

## Task Description

Given the basic application scaffolding, your goal is to build a simple task management
tool similar to [Trello](https://trello.com/en). If you haven't heard about Trello up
until now, now would be a good time to go check it out.

Worry not, you don't have to build a fully-featured clone of Trello. While there are
a few functional and non-functional requirements you will have to meet but we'd like
to encourage you to make it your own unique creation in the first place.

Now, without further ado, go ahead and [set up a new Trello account for free](https://trello.com/signup).
Other than getting some inspiration, you'll also be using Trello to manage your project
until your own app is ready for the prime time. Your project coordinator should've given
you access to a templated Trello board which reflects the best practices in the world
of digital project management.

### Functional Requirements

These are non-negotiable project requirements that you HAVE TO meet to consider your
project shippable:

- functional requirement 1
- functional requirement 2

### Non-functional Requirements

These are non-negotiable project requirements that you HAVE TO meet to consider your
project shippable:

- non-functional requirement 1
- non-functional requirement 2

### Bring Your Own Idea™️

As stated earlier, you're more than encouraged to come up with your own enhancements
and features. Here are a few examples for additional features we thought are nice
to have:

- example of your own idea 1
- example of your own idea 2

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Make a copy of [db/data.json.dist](db/data.json.dist) and rename it to `db/data.json`
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm run start:server```
5. ```npm run start:client```
6. Head out to the Trello board, pick a task and start working on it, then rinse and repeat.
